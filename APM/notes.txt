Intro:
- angular is made of components:
- component =
  template
    - view layout
    - created with html
    - includes binding and directives
  + class(properties and methods)
    - code supporting the view
    - created with TypeScript
    - Properties: data
    - Methods: logic
  + metadata
    - extra data for angular
    - defined with a decorator

- sample application:
  - welcome component
  - product list component
    - star component
  - product detail component
    - star component
  - app component
  - product data service
  - index.html

Setting up an Angular app:
- Manually create all the files
  www.angular.io Quick Start
- Download the results of those steps
  www.angular.io Quick Start
- AngularCli
  https://github.com/angular/angular-cli

Modules
let's say we write a file called product.ts
we can export that file:
  export class Product {
  }
or we can import it
  import { Product } from
  './product'

MetaData:
- A class becomes a component when we give it metadata
- Angular uses that to instantiate the component, construct the view, and interact with the component

Decorator:
- A function that adds metadata to a class, its members or its method arguments.
- Prefixed with an @
- Angular has built in decorators like @Component()
- Positioned immediately in front of the feature being decorated


Index.html
- main page for the application
- single page application (SPA)
- selector is the name of the component when we use it as a directive in html

Component Checklist:
- Class -> code
- Decorator -> MetaData
- Import what we need

Class Checklist:
- Clear name
  - use PascalCasing
  - Append "Component" to the name
- export keyword (makes class accessible)
- Data in properties
  - Appropriate data type
  - Appropriate default value
  - camelCase with first letter lowercase
- Logic in methods
  - camelCase

MetaData Checklist:
- Component decorator:
  - prefix with @, suffix with ()
- selector: Component name in html
  - prefix for clarity
- template: view's html
  - correct html syntax

Import Checklist:
- Defines where to find them embers this component needs
- import keyword
- Member name
  -correct spelling/casing
- Module path
  - enclose in quotes
  - correct spelling/casing

app.components.ts = container component
product-list.components.ts = directive component

- use linked template for more html

- directive component vs app component

- directives is deprecated on component and I can't find a replacement. *ngFor doesn't work on tr elements

- we can make custom directives and use angulars built in directives
- we're going to explore structural directives, which are marked by asterix to start:
*ngIf
*ngFor
